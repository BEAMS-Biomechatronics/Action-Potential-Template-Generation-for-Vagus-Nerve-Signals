# Action-Potential-Template-Generation-for-Vagus-Nerve-Signals
This repository provides the MATLAB and COMSOL Multiphysics models used to generate action potential (AP) templates for fiber-specific detection in vagus nerve electroneurogram (VENG) recordings. These templates are a core component of the pipeline used to characterize active vagal fibers during epileptic seizures in rats.
